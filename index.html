<p style="font-size:120%;">And here is KAngel from Needy Streamer Overload (NSO), just because I think she's pretty. :3 (I'm not problematic, I swear.)</p>

<h3 style="font-size:200%;">My Dislikes! :P</h3> 
 <p style="font-size:160%;"><ul>
    <li><p style="font-size:120%;">FRICKING BUGS. *cries*</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size:120%;">People. But I also like people. So that's a contradiction. (Depends on the person, obviously.)</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size:120%;">Going out to places alone. Like, a restaurant. Homie, I could be eating at home alone if I wanted to be alone. But if I'm going out to places, I'd rather go with other people, too.</p></li>

<h3 style="font-size:200%;">Some Stories About Me</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Comparing Art - This occurred during my sophomore year of highschool. One time, I met a pair of twins who happened to be artists. They spotted me drawing while I was seated at one of the cafeteria tables. And so, they both approached me and told me that they loved my art. Additionally, they asked if I could be their friend. Obviously, I answered yes, because who doesn't want artists for friends? Anyway, the shy and introverted twin was polite and reserved. Meanwhile, the other twin was extroverted and loud. That same extroverted twin told me a few weeks
 later of being friends with me, "Yeah, I'm a great artist. I'm way better than my sister. I'm even better than you." And she said that right to my face. Which is odd, because she drew Sonic FNAF characters and I drew anime during the time. So, how in the world can you compare that to each other? How do you compare Sonic FNAF characters and anime characters and then declare which one is objectively better? Anyway, I physically ghosted her, because I realized she was toxic to myself and her twin sister. I no longer see them, but I hope that the introverted sister will be okay.

<p style="font-size:120%;">Walk It Off - When I was in 6th grade, I went over to my neighbor's house to celebrate her birthday (she, too, was a child). There was a bouncy house, which all the kids played in, myself included. However, after a while, everyone decided to go inside to eat cupcakes. I told them that I wanted to bounce a bit longer, and so I was left alone in the bouncy house. Little did I know, I would accidentally bounce too hard and land wrong. In doing so, I snapped my ankle in a peculiar fashion, and I fell to my side. A shot of pain flooded me, pulsating from my ankle. I laid on the floor of that bouncy house for a few minutes in immense pain, before I slipped out through the entrance of said bouncy house. I tried to walk around, and I was in severe pain. But I didn't want to tell anyone, since I had no intention of ruining a birthday party. And so I pretended I was okay. But my ankle was bent in a slightly weird way. I never went to a hospital. I just walked it off and my ankle was fine and healed ever since. It's completely ordinary and works properly. I walked off a twisted ankle and it worked.

<p style="font-size:120%;">Okay! That's all for now! Kthxbai! - Delaney out!</p>
